** Failures during package install that don't make sense

I.E., you get an error when running the playbook about xbps being unable to install a
package even though xbps-install "${package}" works fine.  In this case, the package
producing the error may not be the one that is reported by ansible.  The most likely
scenario is you need to update your system due to a version conflict in your existing
packages.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xbps-install -Su
#+END_SRC
